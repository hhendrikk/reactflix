// This is just the basic way to add additional webpack configurations.
// For more information refer the docs: https://storybook.js.org/configurations/custom-webpack-config

// IMPORTANT
// When you add this file, we won't add the default configurations which is similar
// to "React Create App". This only has babel loader to load JavaScript.
